# Uber_EDA
I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset after loading it. During the process, I added meaningful new columns, removed irrelevant or non-informative ones, changed data types where necessary for better analysis and efficiency, and saved the transformed data with a reduced file size by 20%. Finally, I answered the following business questions:
Note: the system runs with Km not Miles.
  • For each purpose for each Category calculate the sum of kms driven
  • Describe the kms of all trips
  • Describe the speed of all trips
  • KMS been driven from Fort Pierce to Fort Pierce and how many trips
  • How many Trips in every start city and visualize the top 10
  • How many trips driven in all Months of year and visualize the top 4 month descening
  • How many trips driven in all days of week
  • How many KMS driven in all period of the day and visualiaze them descending
